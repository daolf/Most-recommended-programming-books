# 📕 25 most recommended programming books of all-time

There are countless lists on the internet claiming to be **the** list of must-read programming books and it seemed that all those lists always recommended that same books minus two or three odd choices.

Finding good resources for learning programming is always tricky. Every-one has its own opinion about what book is the best to learn, and as we say in french, "Color and tastes should not be argued about".

However I thought it would be interesting to trust the wisdom of the crown and to find the books that appeared the most in those "Best Programming Book" lists.

If you want to jump right on the results go take a look below at the [full results](#25-most-recommended-programming-books-of-all-time). If you want to learn about the methodology, bear with me.

*Disclaimer: I spent countless hours on this article so I've decided to put Amazon affiliation links to see if those kinds of detailed articles could be a viable source of revenue, ... or not 🤷‍♂️.*

## Methodology:

I've simply asked Google for a few queries like "Best Programming Books" and its variations. I have then scrapped all those pages (using ScrapingBee, a web scraping API I'm working on).

I've deduplicated the links and ended up with nearly 150 links. Using the title of the pages I was also able to quickly discards:

- list focussed on one particular technology or platform
- list focussed on one particular year
- list focussed on free books
- Quora and Reddit threads

I ended up with almost 200 HTML files. I went on opening all the files on my browser, open my chrome inspector, found and wrote the CSS selector matching book titles in the article. This took me around 1hours, almost 30 seconds per page. 

This also allowed me to discard even more nonrelevant pages, and I discarded a lot. In the end, I compiled around 70 lists into this one.

At this moment I had this big JSON file referencing the HTML page previously scrapped, and a CSS selector.

![](https://www.daolf.com/images/programming_book_list/rules.png)

Using Python with Beautiful soup, I've extracted every text inside DOM elements that matched the CSS selector. I ended up with a huge list of books, not usable without some post-processing.

![](https://www.daolf.com/images/programming_book_list/links.png)

To find the most quoted startup books I needed to normalize my results. 

I had to play with  all the different variation like "{title} by {author}" or "{title} - {author}".

Or "{title}:{subtitle}" and "{title}", or even all the one containing edition number. 

I ended up doing it using this simple custom Python function:
```python
def clean_link(link):
    link = link.encode().decode('ascii', errors='ignore')
    link = link.replace("'", '')
    link = link.lower()
    link = ' '.join([w for w in link.split(' ') if w not in ['the', 'a']])
    link = link.split('by')[0]
    link = link.split(':')[0]
    link = link.split('(')[0]
    link = ' '.join(link.split())
    link = link.replace('-', '_')
    link = ''.join([c for c in link if c.isalpha() or c == '_' or c == ' '])
    link = link.strip()
    link = link.replace(' ', '_')
    link = ''.join([c for c in link if c.isalpha() or c == '_'])
    return link
```
 and quite a bit of manual cleaning.

My list now looked like this:

From there it was easy to compute the most recommended books. You can find all the data used to process this list on this [repo](https://github.com/daolf/Most-recommended-programming-books). Now let's take a look at the list:

## 25 most recommended programming books of all-time

### 25. [Continuous Delivery](https://amzn.to/2OZ9JXS) by Jez Humble & David Farley (8.8% recommended)

![](https://www.daolf.com/images/programming_book_list/25.jpg#center)

"Getting software released to users is often a painful, risky, and time-consuming process. This groundbreaking new book sets out the principles and technical practices that enable rapid, incremental delivery of high quality, valuable new functionality to users. Through automation of the build, deployment, and testing process, and improved collaboration between developers, testers, and operations, delivery teams can get changes released in a matter of hours, sometimes even minutes–no matter what the size of a project or the complexity of its code base.

Jez Humble and David Farley begin by presenting the foundations of a rapid, reliable, low-risk delivery process. Next, they introduce the “deployment pipeline,” an automated process for managing all changes, from check-in to release. Finally, they discuss the “ecosystem” needed to
support continuous delivery, from infrastructure, data and configuration management to governance." [Amazon.com](https://amzn.to/2OZ9JXS)

### 24. [Algorithms](https://amzn.to/2u2vpuG) by Robert Sedgewick & Kevin Wayne (8.8% recommended)
![](https://www.daolf.com/images/programming_book_list/24.jpg#center)
"The algorithms in this book represent a body of knowledge developed over the last 50 years that has become indispensable, not just for professional programmers and computer science students but for any student with interests in science, mathematics, and engineering, not to mention students who use computation in the liberal arts."[Amazon.com](https://amzn.to/2u2vpuG)

### 23. [The Self-Taught Programmer](https://amzn.to/325cN9T) by Cory Althoff (8.8% recommended)
![](https://www.daolf.com/images/programming_book_list/23.jpg#center)
"I am a self-taught programmer. After a year of self-study, I learned to program well enough to land a job as a software engineer II at eBay. 

Once I got there, I realized I was severely under-prepared. I was overwhelmed by the amount of things I needed to know but hadn't learned yet. My journey learning to program, and my experience at my first job as a software engineer were the inspiration for this book. 

This book is not just about learning to program; although you will learn to code. If you want to program professionally, it is not enough to learn to code; that is why, in addition to helping you learn to program, I also cover the rest of the things you need to know to program professionally that classes and books don't teach you. 

"The Self-taught Programmer" is a roadmap, a guide to take you from writing your first Python program, to passing your first technical interview. The path is there. Will you take it?"[Amazon.com](https://amzn.to/325cN9T)

### 22. [Rapid Development](https://amzn.to/2SQLQTn) by Steve McConnell (8.8% recommended)
![](https://www.daolf.com/images/programming_book_list/22.jpg#center)
"Corporate and commercial software-development teams all want solutions for one important problem—how to get their high-pressure development schedules under control. In RAPID DEVELOPMENT, author Steve McConnell addresses that concern head-on with overall strategies, specific best practices, and valuable tips that help shrink and control development schedules and keep projects moving. Inside, you’ll find:
- A rapid-development strategy that can be applied to any project and the best practices to make that strategy work
- Candid discussions of great and not-so-great rapid-development practices—estimation, prototyping, forced overtime, motivation, teamwork, rapid-development languages, risk management, and many others
- A list of classic mistakes to avoid for rapid-development projects, including creeping requirements, shortchanged quality, and silver-bullet syndrome
- Case studies that vividly illustrate what can go wrong, what can go right, and how to tell which direction your project is going
- RAPID DEVELOPMENT is the real-world guide to more efficient applications development."[Amazon.com](https://amzn.to/2SQLQTn)

### 20. [Domain-Driven Design](https://amzn.to/38BFCxd) by Eric Evans (10.2% recommended)
![](https://www.daolf.com/images/programming_book_list/20.jpg#center)
"Leading software designers have recognized domain modeling and design as critical topics for at least twenty years, yet surprisingly little has been written about what needs to be done or how to do it. Although it has never been clearly formulated, a philosophy has developed as an undercurrent in the object community, which I call "domain-driven design".

I have spent the past decade focused on developing complex systems in several business and technical domains. I've tried best practices in design and development process as they have emerged from the leaders in the object-oriented development community. Some of my projects were very successful; a few failed. A feature common to the successes was a rich domain model that evolved through iterations of design and became part of the fabric of the project.

This book provides a framework for making design decisions and a technical vocabulary for discussing domain design. It is a synthesis of widely accepted best practices along with my own insights and experiences. Projects facing complex domains can use this framework to approach domain-driven design systematically."[Amazon.com](https://amzn.to/38BFCxd)

### 19. [The Art of Computer Programming](https://amzn.to/2SU7N3Q) by Donald E. Knuth(10.2% recommended)
![](https://www.daolf.com/images/programming_book_list/19.jpg#center)
"Countless readers have spoken about the profound personal influence of Knuth’s work. Scientists have marveled at the beauty and elegance of his analysis, while ordinary programmers have successfully applied his “cookbook” solutions to their day-to-day problems. All have admired Knuth for the breadth, clarity, accuracy, and good humor found in his books."[Amazon.com](https://amzn.to/2SU7N3Q)

### 18. [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://amzn.to/2HJ7HqR) by Harold Abelson / Gerald Jay Sussman / Julie Sussman (13.2% recommended)
![](https://www.daolf.com/images/programming_book_list/17.jpg#center)
"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs has had a dramatic impact on computer science curricula over the past decade. This long-awaited revision contains changes throughout the text. There are new implementations of most of the major programming systems in the book, including the interpreters and compilers, and the authors have incorporated many small changes that reflect their experience teaching the course at MIT since the first edition was published. A new theme has been introduced that emphasizes the central role played by different approaches to dealing with time in computational models: objects with state, concurrent programming, functional programming and lazy evaluation, and nondeterministic programming. There are new example sections on higher-order procedures in graphics and on applications of stream processing in numerical programming, and many new exercises. In addition, all the programs have been reworked to run in any Scheme implementation that adheres to the IEEE standard."[Amazon.com](https://amzn.to/2HJ7HqR)

### 17. [Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture](https://amzn.to/37xEadR) by Martin Fowler (14.7% recommended)
![](https://www.daolf.com/images/programming_book_list/16.jpg#center)
"The practice of enterprise application development has benefited from the emergence of many new enabling technologies. Multi-tiered object-oriented platforms, such as Java and .NET, have become commonplace. These new tools and technologies are capable of building powerful applications, but they are not easily implemented. Common failures in enterprise applications often occur because their developers do not understand the architectural lessons that experienced object developers have learned."[Amazon.com](https://amzn.to/37xEadR)


### 16. [Programming Pearls](https://amzn.to/2u8cOxo) by  Jon Bentley (16.1% recommended)
![](https://www.daolf.com/images/programming_book_list/16-bis.jpg#center)
"Computer programming has many faces. Fred Brooks paints the big picture in The Mythical Man Month; his essays underscore the crucial role of management in large software projects. At a finer grain, Steve McConnell teaches good programming style in Code Complete. The topics in those books are the key to good software and the hallmark of the professional programmer. Unfortunately, though, the workmanlike application of those sound engineering principles isn't always thrilling -- until the software is completed on time and works without surprise.

The columns in this book are about a more glamorous aspect of the profession: programming pearls whose origins lie beyond solid engineering, in the realm of insight and creativity. Just as natural pearls grow from grains of sand that have irritated oysters, these programming pearls have grown from real problems that have irritated real programmers. The programs are fun, and they teach important programming techniques and fundamental design principles."[Amazon.com](https://amzn.to/2u8cOxo)


### 15. [Peopleware](https://amzn.to/2P2YRIh) by Tom DeMarco & Tim Lister (17.6% recommended)

![](https://www.daolf.com/images/programming_book_list/14.jpg#center)
"Some books on algorithms are rigorous but incomplete; others cover masses of material but lack rigor. Introduction to Algorithms uniquely combines rigor and comprehensiveness. The book covers a broad range of algorithms in depth, yet makes their design and analysis accessible to all levels of readers. Each chapter is relatively self-contained and can be used as a unit of study. The algorithms are described in English and in a pseudocode designed to be readable by anyone who has done a little programming. The explanations have been kept elementary without sacrificing depth of coverage or mathematical rigor.

The first edition became a widely used text in universities worldwide as well as the standard reference for professionals. The second edition featured new chapters on the role of algorithms, probabilistic analysis and randomized algorithms, and linear programming. The third edition has been revised and updated throughout. It includes two completely new chapters, on van Emde Boas trees and multithreaded algorithms, substantial additions to the chapter on recurrence (now called “Divide-and-Conquer”), and an appendix on matrices. It features improved treatment of dynamic programming and greedy algorithms and a new notion of edge-based flow in the material on flow networks. Many exercises and problems have been added for this edition. The international paperback edition is no longer available; the hardcover is available worldwide."[Amazon.com](https://amzn.to/2SAdPrt)

### 9. [Design Patterns](https://amzn.to/38Eb9yO) by by Erich Gamma / Richard Helm / Ralph Johnson / John Vlissides (25% recommended)
![](https://www.daolf.com/images/programming_book_list/9.jpg#center)
"Capturing a wealth of experience about the design of object-oriented software, four top-notch designers present a catalog of simple and succinct solutions to commonly occurring design problems. Previously undocumented, these 23 patterns allow designers to create more flexible, elegant, and ultimately reusable designs without having to rediscover the design solutions themselves.

The authors begin by describing what patterns are and how they can help you design object-oriented software. They then go on to systematically name, explain, evaluate, and catalog recurring designs in object-oriented systems. With Design Patterns as your guide, you will learn how these important patterns fit into the software development process, and how you can leverage them to solve your own design problems most efficiently.

Each pattern describes the circumstances in which it is applicable, when it can be applied in view of other design constraints, and the consequences and trade-offs of using the pattern within a larger design. All patterns are compiled from real systems and are based on real-world examples. Each pattern also includes code that demonstrates how it may be implemented in object-oriented programming languages like C++ or Smalltalk."[Amazon.com](https://amzn.to/38Eb9yO)

### 4. [Refactoring](https://amzn.to/2uSs167) by Martin Fowler (35% recommended)
![](https://www.daolf.com/images/programming_book_list/4.jpg#center)
"As the application of object technology--particularly the Java programming language--has become commonplace, a new problem has emerged to confront the software development community. Significant numbers of poorly designed programs have been created by less-experienced developers, resulting in applications that are inefficient and hard to maintain and extend. Increasingly, software system professionals are discovering just how difficult it is to work with these inherited, non-optimal applications. 

For several years, expert-level object programmers have employed a growing collection of techniques to improve the structural integrity and performance of such existing software programs. Referred to as refactoring, these practices have remained in the domain of experts because no attempt has been made to transcribe the lore into a form that all developers could use. . .until now. In Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Software, renowned object technology mentor Martin Fowler breaks new ground, demystifying these master practices and demonstrating how software practitioners can realize the significant benefits of this new process. With proper training a skilled system designer" [Amazon.com](https://amzn.to/2uSs167)

"Clean Code is divided into three parts. The first describes the principles, patterns, and practices of writing clean code. The second part consists of several case studies of increasing complexity. Each case study is an exercise in cleaning up code—of transforming a code base that has some problems into one that is sound and efficient. The third part is the payoff: a single chapter containing a list of heuristics and “smells” gathered while creating the case studies. The result is a knowledge base that describes the way we think when we write, read, and clean code."[Amazon.com](https://amzn.to/2Hy0n0U)

### 1. [The Pragmatic Programmer](https://amzn.to/3bO6Xyb) by David Thomas & Andrew Hunt (67% recommended)

"
The Pragmatic Programmer is one of those rare tech books you’ll read, re-read, and read again over the years. Whether you’re new to the field or an experienced practitioner, you’ll come away with fresh insights each and every time.

Dave Thomas and Andy Hunt wrote the first edition of this influential book in 1999 to help their clients create better software and rediscover the joy of coding. These lessons have helped a generation of programmers examine the very essence of software development, independent of any particular language, framework, or methodology, and the Pragmatic philosophy has spawned hundreds of books, screencasts, and audio books, as well as thousands of careers and success stories.

Now, twenty years later, this new edition re-examines what it means to be a modern programmer. Topics range from personal responsibility and career development to architectural techniques for keeping your code flexible and easy to adapt and reuse."[Amazon.com](https://amzn.to/3bO6Xyb)

## Conclusion

Although the order might suprise some, by definition, most of you must have heard of these books already.

A few additional things I learned making this list: 

- Marting Fowler, Robert C. Martin and Steve McConnell are the only authors with several books in the list.
- Cracking the Coding interview is the most recent book on the list, released in 2015.
- [Python Programming](https://amzn.to/321qbMx), by John Zelle was the most cited book focused on one language. It would have #5 had I taken it into account.

I hope you enjoyed this article. 

I must admit, this one took a while to write. If you liked this article and feel like Twitter would like it please do not hesitate to love and retweet, it really does help :).
