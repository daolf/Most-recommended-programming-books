<h4><a href="https://lukeplant.me.uk/blog/posts/double-checked-locking-with-django-orm/">Double-checked locking with Django ORM</a></h4>
<p>
</p><p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-checked_locking">double-checked locking</a> pattern is one that is
useful&nbsp;when:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>You need to restrict access to a certain resource to stop simultaneous processes from working on it at the same&nbsp;time.</li>
<li>The locking patterns available to you have significant&nbsp;costs.</li>
</ol>
<p>This post is about how we can implement this pattern in Django, using the <span class="caps">ORM</span>
and database level locking features. The pattern applies if you are not using
Django, or indeed any <span class="caps">ORM</span>, but I have only checked it for Django, and in fact
only really verified it works as expected using&nbsp;PostgreSQL.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-situation">
<h2>The&nbsp;situation</h2>
<p>You have some database records that require ‘processing’ of some kind, but need
to ensure that they are only processed once. For example, in your e-commerce
system, you might want to send an email to your users when their order is
shipped, but make sure you only send one. You’ve got something like&nbsp;this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="code python literal-block"><span></span><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Order</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">models</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Model</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">shipped_at</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">models</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">DateTimeField</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">null</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="bp">True</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">shipped_email_sent</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">models</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">BooleanField</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">default</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="bp">False</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Email sending may take a little time, or fail, so we have some kind of
background job to do this. We could use a job queue like Celery to do this and
ensure that only one process at a time attempts to do the sending, but maybe we
don’t have a queue like that, or maybe we don’t trust it to have been configured
correctly&nbsp;etc.</p>
<p>We’re using <tt class="docutils literal">shipped_email_sent</tt> to track whether we’ve sent the emails or
not, but even if we filter on that, simultaneous processes launched at the same
moment could end up sending emails twice, due to the delay between querying and
updating the records. We could use <tt class="docutils literal">select_for_update()</tt>, but want to avoid
locking this important table anymore than absolutely necessary. What should we&nbsp;do?</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="solution">
<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>I’ll present my solution, and then explain afterwards. But the notes are
important — don’t just copy-paste&nbsp;this!</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="code python literal-block"><span></span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">send_pending_order_shipped_emails</span><span class="p">():</span>

                <span class="n">send_shipped_email</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">order</span><span class="p">)</span>

                <span class="n">order</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">save</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="explanation">
<h2>Explanation</h2>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>This whole block of code should be executed <strong>outside</strong> an atomic&nbsp;block.</li>
<li>Note that the outer <tt class="docutils literal">orders_to_email</tt> block is therefore outside a
transaction, and uses no locking. So, if this query return no results, the
whole process does just a single read query, without locking, and exits. This
is great for performance and avoiding contention on the <span class="caps">DB</span>.</li>
<li>If there are items to process, we <strong>then</strong> start an atomic transaction&nbsp;block.</li>
<li>Since the first query was outside a transaction, another process may have
beaten us to it, we have to do another query to make sure the record still
matches the criteria — the inner&nbsp;query.</li>
<li>This time we use <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="caps">SELECT</span> <span class="caps">FOR</span> <span class="caps">UPDATE</span></tt>, so that no other process will be
able to enter this block for this row at the same&nbsp;time.</li>
<li>We use <tt class="docutils literal">skip_locked</tt> so that if someone else does beat us to it, we just
skip the record and try the next&nbsp;one.</li>
<li>We set a flag that ensures that this record will no longer be found
by the <tt class="docutils literal">orders_to_email</tt> query.</li>
</ol>
<p>The result is that we guarantee each record gets processed at most&nbsp;once.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="notes">
<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">I’ve only checked this with PostgreSQL and the default isolation level of
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="caps">READ</span> <span class="caps">COMMITTED</span></tt>.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Note the use of Django QuerySets: We define the correctly filtered query once,
and then we re-use with chaining to execute it multiple times. We are relying
on the fact that the additional <tt class="docutils literal">filter</tt> etc. are creating a new,
unevaluated <tt class="docutils literal">QuerySet</tt>, which executes a new query when we loop over it with
the second for&nbsp;loop.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Making sure you read the notes for <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/models/querysets/#select-for-update">select_for_update</a>
and use <tt class="docutils literal">of</tt> parameter as&nbsp;appropriate.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">We guarantee “at most once” — <strong>but that allows the possibility of zero
times</strong>. If you have other, different processes that are also locking those
rows in the table (not just multiple copies of this code executing this same
code), then the <tt class="docutils literal">skip_locked=True</tt> flag means this process could exit
without having processed all the rows, and without any errors. If you don’t
mind having to try multiple times to be sure, that should be <span class="caps">OK</span>. In other
words, this code is assuming “everyone else is more important than&nbsp;me.”</p>
<p>I think you could change this by using <tt class="docutils literal">select_for_update(nowait=True)</tt>
instead, combined with appropriate&nbsp;try/except/looping.</p>
<p>For trying multiple times, we&nbsp;could:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Leave that to the next time our background job attempts this,&nbsp;or</li>
<li>Do some counting inside the two loops, and if the inner loop comes up
short, we know that for some reason we skipped some rows (it could have
been because someone else already processed the row, or because someone
else locked the rows for a different reason). If so, recursively call
<tt class="docutils literal">send_pending_order_shipped_emails</tt>. This recursion will definitely
terminate when <tt class="docutils literal">orders_to_email</tt> comes up empty, or when we succeed to
process everything in&nbsp;it.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Performance note: we are doing N+1 read queries to process all the pending
records, plus N writes. You might need to be aware of that, compared to doing
1 read and 1 write if we did them all together and used some other mechanism
to ensure we didn’t have multiple competing&nbsp;processes.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">If you have multiple processes racing to process the pending records, the
above code will naturally distribute the work between them approximately
equally — you get work distribution for&nbsp;free.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">I’ve tried to find ways to encapsulate this pattern more neatly in
Django/Python, like <tt class="docutils literal">with double_checked_locking(queryset)</tt> but so far had
no luck at producing something materially better (like <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pinax/django-mailer/blob/80f3d3d18d19010e95d306c32532cf045060b801/src/mailer/engine.py#L43">this in django-mailer</a>,
which works <span class="caps">OK</span> but has an <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pinax/django-mailer/blob/80f3d3d18d19010e95d306c32532cf045060b801/src/mailer/engine.py#L181">awkward usage pattern</a>).
I think this one is better just doing every time, especially given some of the
issues&nbsp;above.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Anything else? My understanding of how PostgreSQL isolation levels and
transactions work, along with my experiments (using good ol’ <tt class="docutils literal">time.sleep()</tt>)
seem to confirm this works as per the description and notes above, but if I’ve
missed something please add a&nbsp;comment!</p>

<h4><a href="https://blog.gocept.com/2020/02/28/zope-may-sprint/">Zope May Sprint</a></h4>
<p>
</p><p>Earl Zope has settled down for a good while in <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://blog.gocept.com/2019/05/10/celebration-zope-4-final-release/" target="_blank">Python 3 wonderland</a>. He made friends with the inhabitants and other immigrants. He enjoys his new live. </p>



<p>The sunset of his original homelands took place as predicted by the <a href="https://pythonclock.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">beginning </a><a href="https://pythonclock.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">of January 2020</a>. As Earl Zope was well prepared this was no longer a frightening  date for him.</p>



<p>But even living in Python 3 wonderland is not only joy and relaxing. The Python 3 wonderland changes in a more rapid speed than the Python 2 land ever had before: Each year a new policy has to be fulfilled (aka new Python version release). Additionally it is time to drop the last connections to the old Python 2 land to ease the transformation in Python 3 wonderland to make developers and consumers happy.</p>



<p>Earl Zope is grateful for all the help he already gained: There where several Zope 4 releases and a first <a href="https://community.plone.org/t/zope-5-0a1-released/11786" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zope 5 alpha</a> version was just released. Even though Earl Zope still needs your help to:</p>



<ul><li>prepare dependencies to ease transition to new Python versions (aka make repositories more uniform to ease updating to new Python versions.)</li><li>drop Python 2 support in repositories of dependencies</li><li>support and test with newer Python 3 versions (aka current 3.9 alpha)</li><li>improve and update the documentation</li></ul>



<p>You are invited to the “<strong>Zope May sprint</strong>” located in <strong>Halle</strong>/Saale, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f1e9-1f1ea.png" alt="🇩🇪" class="wp-smiley"> from <strong>13th till 15h of May</strong> 2020 hosted by gocept. In order to coordinate the participation for this sprint, we ask you to join us on&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/Zope-Sprint/events/269031661/" target="_blank">Meetup</a>. We can then coordinate the catering and requirements for space.</p><p></p>

<h4><a href="">Adding Metadata to PDFs</a></h4>
<p>
</p><p>For both <a href="https://www.roygreenfeld.com/collections/two-scoops-press/products/django-crash-course">Django Crash Course</a> and the forthcoming Two Scoops of Django 3.x, we're using a new process to render the PDFs. Unfortunately, until just a few days ago that process didn't include the cover. Instead, covers were inserted manually using Adobe Acrobat. </p>

<p>While that manual process worked, <a href="https://github.com/roygreenfeld/django-crash-course/issues/132">it came with predictable consequences</a>.</p>

<h2>Merging the PDFs</h2>

<p>This part was easy and found in any number of blog articles and Stack Overflow answers. </p>

<ul>
<li>Step 1: Install <a href="https://pypi.org/project/PyPDF2/">pypdf2</a></li>
<li>Step 2: Write a script as seen below</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>from PyPDF2 import PdfFileMerger

now = datetime.now()

pdfs = [
  'images/Django_Crash_Course_5.5x8in.pdf',
  '_output/dcc.pdf',
]

merger = PdfFileMerger()

for pdf in pdfs:
    merger.append(pdf)

merger.write("releases/beta-20200226.pdf")
merger.close()    
</code></pre>

<p>It was at this point that we discovered that our new file, <code>releases/beta-20200226.pdf</code>, was missing most of the metadata. Oh no!</p>

<h2>Adding the Metadata</h2>

<p>According to the PyPDF2 docs, <a href="https://pythonhosted.org/PyPDF2/PdfFileMerger.html#PyPDF2.PdfFileMerger.addMetadata">adding metadata is very straight-forward</a>. Just pass a <code>dict</code> into the <code>addMetadata()</code> function. I inserted this code right before the call to <code>merger.write()</code>:</p>

<pre><code>merger.addMetadata({
    "Title": "Django Crash Course",  
    "Authors": 'Daniel Roy Greenfeld, Audrey Roy Greenfeld',
    "Description": "Covers Python 3.8 and Django 3.x",
    "ContentCreator": "Two Scoops Press",
    "CreateDate": "2020-02-26",
    "ModifyDate": "2020-02-26",
})
</code></pre>

<p>The PDF built! Yeah! Time to open it up and see the results!</p>

<p>Alas, no metadata showed up.</p>

<p>Then I spent a long time with trial-and-error trying to get the metadata to show up properly. While there are lots of Python-related articles on <strong>extracting</strong> metadata using PyPDF2, I struggled to find anything that explained how to add metadata.  </p>

<h2>Doing My Homework</h2>

<p>After a bunch of research (googling, stack overlow-ing, and visiting forums) I found a wonderful book on O'Reilly called <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/pdf-explained/9781449321581/">PDF Explained</a> by John Whitington. Much credit to John Whitington, he's a good writer and very knowledgable on the topic of PDF. </p>

<p>For my purposes, the two critical sections were found in Chapter 4 of PDF Explained:</p>

<ul>
<li>https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/pdf-explained/9781449321581/ch04.html#didentries</li>
<li>https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/pdf-explained/9781449321581/ch04.html#dates</li>
</ul>

<p>Based off what I read, I established the following rules:</p>

<ul>
<li>Every metadata field name had to be prefixed with <code>/</code></li>
<li>Stick to the metadata names found in chapter 4 </li>
<li>Follow the date format supplied in chapter 4</li>
</ul>

<h2>Writing the Code!</h2>

<p>Now armed with my rules I returned to the code. This is what I came up with:</p>

<pre><code>from datetime import datetime
from PyPDF2 import PdfFileMerger

pdfs = [
  'images/Django_Crash_Course_5.5x8in.pdf',
  '_output/dcc.pdf',
]

merger = PdfFileMerger()

for pdf in pdfs:
    merger.append(pdf)

# Make PDF datestamp
now = datetime.now()
pdf_datestamp = now.strftime("D:%Y%m%d%H%M%S-8'00'")

# https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/pdf-explained/9781449321581/ch04.html#didentries
# Fields are **precisely** named
merger.addMetadata({
    "/Author": 'Daniel Roy Greenfeld, Audrey Roy Greenfeld',
    "/Title": "Django Crash Course",
    "/Subject": "Covers Python 3.8 and Django 3.x",
    "/Creator": "Two Scoops Press",
    "/CreationDate": pdf_datestamp,
    "/ModDate": pdf_datestamp,
})

# Write the release
version = f"beta-{now.strftime('%Y%m%d')}"
merger.write(f"releases/{version}.pdf")
merger.close()
</code></pre>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The lesson I learned writing this little utility is that as useful as Google and Stack Overflow might be, sometimes you need to explore reference manuals. Which, if you ask me, is a lot of fun. :-)</p>

<p>Speaking of reference manuals, while I referenced the online version of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B006H4DAE6/?tag=mlinar-20">PDF Explained</a> to get my work done, I've ordered a kindle version of the book. It's the least I can do.</p><p></p>

<h4><a href="https://lerner.co.il/2020/02/26/want-to-spend-more-time-coding-python-and-less-time-on-stack-overflow/">Want to spend more time coding Python, and less time on Stack Overflow?</a></h4>
<p>
</p><p>
How many times a day do you visit Stack Overflow?&nbsp; (If you’re like most 
programmers, the answer is “many.”)&nbsp; Wouldn’t it be nice to just be able
 to write Python code, without interrupting your work every few hours to
 check (or double-check) something?<br><br>
After all, whether you’re a data scientist, app developer, or just a 
hobbyist, your goal isn’t to search for answers to your problems. <strong>Your goal is to actually solve those problems. </strong><br><br>
Consider what would happen if you were able to use all of that search-for-answers time on actually solving problems:
</p>



<ul><li>You <strong>wouldn’t have to read bad and semi-bad answers</strong> before (finally) finding the right solution.</li><li>You <strong>wouldn’t have to mess with the answer you found</strong>, to make it appropriate for your situation.</li><li>You <strong>could take on bigger and more complex projects</strong>, because you’d be able to concentrate on the higher-level ideas and problems, doing the simpler stuff easily and quickly.</li><li>You would <strong>write shorter and more expressive code</strong>, impressing others and making future maintenance easier.</li><li>You would be able to <strong>delight your clients with faster turnaround time</strong> and more sophisticated solutions.</li></ul>



<p>
People are using Python for all sorts of amazing things nowadays. But 
you’re only able to do those amazing things when you’re solving 
problems, not when you’re dealing with the nuts and bolts, or searching 
for answers online:

</p>



<ul><li>Become a data scientist, contributing to everything from <strong>drug discovery to financial models to self-driving cars</strong>.
 (As you might know, Python is the leading language in data science and 
machine learning — so knowing it is the key to getting a job in this 
hot industry.)</li><li>Create Web applications, using Python-based frameworks such as Django and Flask, to create <strong>sites like Instagram, Pinterest, and Dropbox</strong>.</li><li>Automate your home or office on a Raspberry Pi, <strong>integrating systems such as temperature sensors to microcontrollers</strong> in a single program.</li><li>Use a single language to <strong>automate everything on your computer</strong>, instead of using such domain-specific languages as VBA and bash.</li></ul>

<p>On March 10th, I’m starting a cohort of Weekly Python Exercise, my 15-week course specifically designed to <strong>improve your Python fluency</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp; (This is  cohort B1, one of three advanced cohorts I offer each year.)<br><br> This cohort is aimed at anyone with at least 6-8 months of Python under  their belt, who wants to go beyond basic data structures, function  definitions, and objects — learning about and getting better at such  topics as: </p>



<ul><li>iterators</li><li>generators</li><li>decorators</li><li>advanced object-oriented techniques</li><li>threads and processes</li></ul>

<h4><a href="https://realpython.com/beginners-guide-python-turtle/">The Beginner's Guide to Python Turtle</a></h4>
<p>
</p><p>When I was a kid, I used to learn <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)">Logo</a>, a programming language that involved a turtle that you could move around the screen with just a few commands. I remember feeling like a computer genius as I controlled this little object on my screen, and this was what got me interested in programming in the first place. The Python <code>turtle</code> library comes with a similar interactive feature that gives new programmers a taste of what it’s like to work with Python.</p>
<p><strong>In this tutorial, you will:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Understand</strong> what the Python <code>turtle</code> library is</li>
<li><strong>Learn</strong> how to set <code>turtle</code> up on your computer</li>
<li><strong>Program</strong> with the Python <code>turtle</code> library</li>
<li><strong>Grasp</strong> some important Python concepts and <code>turtle</code> commands</li>
<li><strong>Develop</strong> a short but entertaining game using what you’ve learned</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re a beginner to Python, then this tutorial will help you as you take your first steps into the world of programming with the help of the Python <code>turtle</code> library!</p>
<div class="alert alert-warning"><p><strong>Free Bonus:</strong> <a href="https://realpython.com/atom.xml" class="alert-link">Click here to get a Python Cheat Sheet</a> and learn the basics of Python 3, like working with data types, dictionaries, lists, and Python functions.</p></div>

<h2 id="getting-to-know-the-python-turtle-library">Getting to Know the Python <code>turtle</code> Library</h2>
<p><code>turtle</code> is a pre-installed Python library that enables users to create pictures and shapes by providing them with a virtual canvas. The onscreen pen that you use for drawing is called the <strong>turtle</strong> and this is what gives the library its name. In short, the Python <code>turtle</code> library helps new programmers get a feel for what programming with Python is like in a fun and interactive way.</p>
<p><code>turtle</code> is mainly used to introduce children to the world of computers. It’s a straightforward yet versatile way to understand the concepts of Python. This makes it a great avenue for <a href="https://realpython.com/best-python-books/#python-for-kids-a-playful-introduction-to-programming">kids</a> to take their first steps in Python programming. That being said, the Python <code>turtle</code> library is not restricted to little ones alone! It’s also proved extremely useful for adults who are trying their hands at Python, which makes it great for Python <a href="https://realpython.com/learning-paths/python3-introduction/">beginners</a>.</p>
<p>With the Python <code>turtle</code> library, you can draw and create various types of shapes and images. Here’s a sample of the kinds of drawings you can make with <code>turtle</code>:</p>
<p><a href="https://files.realpython.com/media/Turtle_Initial_Demo_GIF.923f9cc7d490.gif" target="_blank"><img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block border w-50" src="https://files.realpython.com/media/Turtle_Initial_Demo_GIF.923f9cc7d490.gif" width="480" height="466" alt="Python Turtle Initial Demo"></a></p>
<p>Cool, right? This is just one of many different drawings you can make using the Python <code>turtle</code> library. Most developers use <code>turtle</code> to draw shapes, create designs, and make images. Others use <code>turtle</code> to create mini-games and animations, just like the one you saw above.</p>
<h2 id="getting-started-with-turtle">Getting Started With <code>turtle</code></h2>
<p>Before you continue, there are two important things that you’ll need to do to make the most of this tutorial:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Python Environment:</strong> Make sure that you’re familiar with your programming <a href="https://realpython.com/learning-paths/perfect-your-python-development-setup/">environment</a>. You can use applications like <a href="https://realpython.com/python-idle/">IDLE</a> or <a href="https://realpython.com/jupyter-notebook-introduction/">Jupyter Notebook</a> to program with <code>turtle</code>. However, if you’re not comfortable with them, then you can program with the <a href="https://realpython.com/interacting-with-python/">REPL</a>, which you’ll use in this tutorial.</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>The good thing about <code>turtle</code> is that it’s a built-in library, so you don’t need to install any new packages. All you need to do is import the library into your Python environment, which in this case would be the REPL. Once you open your REPL application, you can run Python 3 on it by typing the following line of code:</p>
<div class="highlight python repl"><span class="repl-toggle" title="Toggle REPL prompts and output">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">python3</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This calls Python 3 into your REPL application and opens up the environment for you. </p>
<p>Before you begin your Python programming, you need to understand what a <strong>library</strong> is. In the non-computer world, a library is a place where different types of books are stored. You can access these books at any time, take whatever information you need from them, and return them to the same place.  </p>
<p>In the computer world, a library works similarly. By definition, a <strong>library</strong> is a set of important functions and methods that you can access to make your programming easier. The Python <code>turtle</code> library contains all the methods and functions that you’ll need to create your images. To access a Python library, you need to import it into your Python environment, like this:</p>
<div class="highlight python repl"><span class="repl-toggle" title="Toggle REPL prompts and output">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">turtle</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Now that you have <code>turtle</code> in your Python environment, you can begin programming with it. <code>turtle</code> is a graphical library, which means you’ll need to create a separate window (called the <strong>screen</strong>) to carry out each drawing command. You can create this screen by initializing a variable for it.</p>
<p>In Python, you use <strong>variables</strong> to store information that you’ll use later on in your program. You <strong>initialize</strong> a variable when you assign a starting value to it. Since the value of the variable isn’t constant, it can change several times during the execution of your program.</p>
<p>Now, to open the <code>turtle</code> screen, you initialize a variable for it in the following way:</p>
<div class="highlight python repl"><span class="repl-toggle" title="Toggle REPL prompts and output">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">s</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">turtle</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">getscreen</span><span class="p">()</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>You should see a separate window open up:</p>
<p><a href="https://files.realpython.com/media/Screenshot_2019-12-10_at_7.40.34_AM.86e4071c3bb4.png" target="_blank"><img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block border w-50" src="https://files.realpython.com/media/Screenshot_2019-12-10_at_7.40.34_AM.86e4071c3bb4.png" width="719" height="696" alt="Python Turtle Initial Screen New"></a></p>
<p>This window is called the <strong>screen</strong>. It’s where you can view the output of your code. The little black triangular shape in the middle of the screen is called the <strong>turtle</strong>.</p>
<div class="alert alert-primary">
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Keep in mind that when you name a variable, you need to pick a name that can be easily understood by anyone who’s looking at your program. However, you must also choose a name that’s convenient for you to use, especially because you’ll be calling it very often throughout your program!</p>
<p>For example, choosing a name like <code>my_turtle_screen_name</code> would be tedious to keep typing, while a name like <code>Joe</code> or <code>a</code> would appear to be very random. Using a single alphabet character, like <code>s</code> in this case, would be much more suitable. That’s because it’s short and sweet, and it’s clear to remember that the letter <code>s</code> refers to the <strong>screen</strong>.</p>
</div>
<p>Next, you initialize the variable <code>t</code>, which you’ll then use throughout the program to refer to the turtle:</p>
<div class="highlight python repl"><span class="repl-toggle" title="Toggle REPL prompts and output">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">t</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">turtle</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Turtle</span><span class="p">()</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Just like for the screen, you can also give this variable another name like <code>a</code> or <code>Jane</code> or even <code>my_turtle</code>, but in this case, you’ll stick with <code>t</code>.</p>
<p>You now have your screen and your turtle. The screen acts as a canvas, while the turtle acts like a pen. You can program the turtle to move around the screen. The turtle has certain changeable characteristics, like size, color, and speed. It always points in a specific direction, and will move in that direction unless you tell it otherwise:</p>
<ul>
<li>When it’s <strong>up</strong>, it means that no line will be drawn when it moves.</li>
<li>When it’s <strong>down</strong>, it means that a line will be drawn when it moves.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the next section, you’ll explore the different ways of programming with the Python <code>turtle</code> library.</p>
<h2 id="programming-with-turtle">Programming With <code>turtle</code></h2>
<p>The first thing you’ll learn when it comes to programming with the Python <code>turtle</code> library is how to make the turtle move in the direction you want it to go. Next, you’ll learn how to customize your turtle and its environment. Finally, you’ll learn a couple of extra commands with which you can perform some special tasks.</p>
<h3 id="moving-the-turtle">Moving the Turtle</h3>
<p>There are four directions that a turtle can move in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Forward</li>
<li>Backward</li>
<li>Left</li>
<li>Right</li>
</ul>
<p>The turtle moves <code>.forward()</code> or <code>.backward()</code> in the direction that it’s facing. You can change this direction by turning it <code>.left()</code> or <code>.right()</code> by a certain degree. You can try each of these commands like so:</p>
<div class="highlight python repl"><span class="repl-toggle" title="Toggle REPL prompts and output">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">right</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">90</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">forward</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">left</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">90</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">backward</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>When you run these commands, the turtle will turn right by ninety degrees, go forward by a hundred units, turn left by ninety degrees, and move backward by a hundred units. You can see how this looks in the image below:</p>
<p><a href="https://files.realpython.com/media/Update_-_Moving_Turtle_VIDEO_GIF.61623cf40fed.gif" target="_blank"><img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block border w-50" src="https://files.realpython.com/media/Update_-_Moving_Turtle_VIDEO_GIF.61623cf40fed.gif" width="480" height="466" alt="Python Turtle Moving Updated"></a></p>
<p>You can use the shortened versions of these commands as well:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>t.rt()</code></strong> instead of <code>t.right()</code></li>
<li><strong><code>t.fd()</code></strong> instead of <code>t.forward()</code></li>
<li><strong><code>t.lt()</code></strong> instead of <code>t.left()</code></li>
<li><strong><code>t.bk()</code></strong> instead of <code>t.backward()</code></li>
</ul>
<p>You can also draw a line from your current position to any other arbitrary position on the screen. This is done with the help of coordinates:</p>
<p><a href="https://files.realpython.com/media/Turtle_EDIT_Graph.790c213ce0ba.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block w-50" src="https://files.realpython.com/media/Turtle_EDIT_Graph.790c213ce0ba.jpg" width="1080" height="1080" alt="Python Turtle Coordinates New"></a></p>
<p>The screen is divided into four <a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/cartesian-coordinates.html">quadrants</a>. The point where the turtle is initially positioned at the beginning of your program is <code>(0,0)</code>. This is called <strong>Home</strong>. To move the turtle to any other area on the screen, you use <code>.goto()</code> and enter the coordinates like this:</p>
<div class="highlight python repl"><span class="repl-toggle" title="Toggle REPL prompts and output">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">goto</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Your output will look like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://files.realpython.com/media/TURTLE_EDIT_GOTO_GIF.ac9b7de34b40.gif" target="_blank"><img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block border w-50" src="https://files.realpython.com/media/TURTLE_EDIT_GOTO_GIF.ac9b7de34b40.gif" width="480" height="464" alt="Python Turtle GOTO NEWER"></a></p>
<p>You’ve drawn a line from your current position to the point <code>(100,100)</code> on the screen.</p>
<p>To bring the turtle back to its home position, you type the following:</p>
<div class="highlight python repl"><span class="repl-toggle" title="Toggle REPL prompts and output">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">home</span><span class="p">()</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This is like a shortcut command that sends the turtle back to the point <code>(0,0)</code>. It’s quicker than typing <code>t.goto(0,0)</code>.</p>
<h3 id="drawing-a-shape">Drawing a Shape</h3>
<p>Now that you know the movements of the turtle, you can move on to making actual shapes. You can start by drawing <strong>polygons</strong> since they all consist of straight lines connected at certain angles. Here’s an example that you can try:</p>
<div class="highlight python repl"><span class="repl-toggle" title="Toggle REPL prompts and output">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">fd</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">rt</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">90</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">fd</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">rt</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">90</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">fd</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">rt</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">90</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">fd</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Your output will look like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://files.realpython.com/media/TURTLE_SQUARE_EDIT.626bc3fccd67.gif" target="_blank"><img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block border w-50" src="https://files.realpython.com/media/TURTLE_SQUARE_EDIT.626bc3fccd67.gif" width="480" height="466" alt="Python Turtle Square Edit Newer"></a></p>
<p>Well done! You’ve just drawn a square. In this way, the turtle can be programmed to <strong>create different shapes and images</strong>.</p>
<p>Now, try drawing a rectangle, using this code as a template. Remember, in a rectangle, all four sides are not equal. You’ll need to change the code accordingly. Once you do that, you can even try creating other polygons by increasing the number of sides and changing the angles.</p>
<h3 id="drawing-preset-figures">Drawing Preset Figures</h3>
<p>Suppose you want to draw a <strong>circle</strong>. If you attempt to draw it in the same way as you drew the square, then it would be extremely tedious, and you’d have to spend a lot of time just for that one shape. Thankfully, the Python <code>turtle</code> library provides a solution for this. You can use a single command to draw a circle:  </p>
<div class="highlight python repl"><span class="repl-toggle" title="Toggle REPL prompts and output">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">circle</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">60</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>You’ll get an output like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://files.realpython.com/media/Update_-_Turtle_Circle_GIF.14906fdf5060.gif" target="_blank"><img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block border w-50" src="https://files.realpython.com/media/Update_-_Turtle_Circle_GIF.14906fdf5060.gif" width="480" height="468" alt="Python Turtle Circle Updated"></a></p>
<p>The number within the brackets is the <strong>radius</strong> of the circle. You can increase or decrease the size of the circle by changing the value of its radius.</p>
<p>In the same way, you can also draw a <strong>dot</strong>, which is nothing but a filled-in circle. Type in this command:</p>
<div class="highlight python repl"><span class="repl-toggle" title="Toggle REPL prompts and output">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">dot</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">20</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>You’ll get a filled-in circle like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://files.realpython.com/media/Turtle_Dot_Pic.8f171e2c7d98.png" target="_blank"><img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block border w-50" src="https://files.realpython.com/media/Turtle_Dot_Pic.8f171e2c7d98.png" width="721" height="697" alt="Python Turtle Dot Update"></a></p>
<p>The number within the brackets is the diameter of the dot. Just like with the circle, you can increase or decrease the size of the dot by changing the value of its diameter.</p>
<p>Great job so far! You’ve learned how to move the turtle around and create different shapes with it. In the next few sections, you’ll see how you can customize your turtle and its environment, based on your requirements.</p>
<h3 id="changing-the-screen-color">Changing the Screen Color</h3>
<p>By default, <code>turtle</code> always opens up a screen with a white background. However, you can change the <strong>color</strong> of the screen at any time using the following command:</p>
<div class="highlight python repl"><span class="repl-toggle" title="Toggle REPL prompts and output">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">turtle</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">bgcolor</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"blue"</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>You can replace <code>"blue"</code> with any other color. Try <code>"green"</code> or <code>"red"</code>. You’ll get a result like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://files.realpython.com/media/1-BG_COLOR-GIF.8619d9e1783f.gif" target="_blank"><img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block border w-50" src="https://files.realpython.com/media/1-BG_COLOR-GIF.8619d9e1783f.gif" width="478" height="462" alt="Python Turtle Background Color"></a></p>
<p>You can use a variety of colors for your screen just by typing in their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors">hex code</a> number. To learn more about using different colors, check out the Python <code>turtle</code> library <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#turtle.color">documentation</a>.</p>
<h3 id="changing-the-screen-title">Changing the Screen Title</h3>
<p>Sometimes, you may want to change the <strong>title</strong> of your screen. You can make it more personal, like <code>"My Turtle Program"</code>, or more suitable to what you’re working on, like <code>"Drawing Shapes With Turtle"</code>. You can change the title of your screen with the help of this command:</p>
<div class="highlight python repl"><span class="repl-toggle" title="Toggle REPL prompts and output">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">turtle</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">title</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"My Turtle Program"</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Your title bar will now display this:</p>
<p><a href="https://files.realpython.com/media/Change_in_Screen_Title_UPDATE.bf645f90e3d0.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block border w-50" src="https://files.realpython.com/media/Change_in_Screen_Title_UPDATE.bf645f90e3d0.jpg" width="600" height="200" alt="Python Turtle Screen Title Updated"></a></p>
<p>In this way, you can change the heading of your screen according to your preference.</p>
<h3 id="changing-the-turtle-size">Changing the Turtle Size</h3>
<p>You can increase or decrease the <strong>size</strong> of the onscreen turtle to make it bigger or smaller. This changes only the size of the shape without affecting the output of the pen as it draws on the screen. Try typing in the following commands:</p>
<div class="highlight python repl"><span class="repl-toggle" title="Toggle REPL prompts and output">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">shapesize</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">shapesize</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">shapesize</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">shapesize</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Your outputs will look like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://files.realpython.com/media/Turtle_Shape_Size_Updated_GIF.3f31c5f85340.gif" target="_blank"><img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block border w-50" src="https://files.realpython.com/media/Turtle_Shape_Size_Updated_GIF.3f31c5f85340.gif" width="478" height="462" alt="Python Turtle Shape Size Updated"></a></p>
<p>The numbers given are the <strong>parameters</strong> for the size of the turtle:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stretch length</li>
<li>Stretch width</li>
<li>Outline width</li>
</ul>
<p>You can change these according to your preference. In the example given above, you can see a visible difference in the appearance of the turtle. For more information on how you can change the size of the turtle, check out the Python <code>turtle</code> library <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#turtle.turtlesize">documentation</a>.</p>
<h3 id="changing-the-pen-size">Changing the Pen Size</h3>
<p>The previous command changed the size of the turtle’s shape only. However, sometimes, you may need to increase or decrease the <strong>thickness</strong> of your pen. You can do this using the following command:</p>
<div class="highlight python repl"><span class="repl-toggle" title="Toggle REPL prompts and output">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">pensize</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">forward</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This results in an outcome like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://files.realpython.com/media/Pen_Size_GIF.4d1fb1beefd6.gif" target="_blank"><img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block border w-50" src="https://files.realpython.com/media/Pen_Size_GIF.4d1fb1beefd6.gif" width="478" height="464" alt="Python Turtle Pen Size More NEW"></a></p>
<p>As you can see, the size of your pen is now five times the original size (which was one). Try drawing some more lines of various sizes, and compare the difference in thickness between them.</p>
<h3 id="changing-the-turtle-and-pen-color">Changing the Turtle and Pen Color</h3>
<p>When you first open a new screen, the turtle starts out as a black figure and draws with black ink. Based on your requirements, you can do two things:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Change the color of the turtle:</strong> This changes the fill color.</li>
<li><strong>Change the color of the pen:</strong> This changes the outline or the ink color.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can even choose both of these if you wish. Before you change the colors, increase the size of your turtle to help you see the color difference more clearly. Type in this code:</p>
<div class="highlight python repl"><span class="repl-toggle" title="Toggle REPL prompts and output">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">shapesize</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Now, to change the color of the turtle (or the fill), you type the following:</p>
<div class="highlight python repl"><span class="repl-toggle" title="Toggle REPL prompts and output">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">fillcolor</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"red"</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Your turtle will look like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://files.realpython.com/media/Turtle_Fill_Color_Red_Update.216d34fcf201.png" target="_blank"><img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block border w-50" src="https://files.realpython.com/media/Turtle_Fill_Color_Red_Update.216d34fcf201.png" width="722" height="698" alt="Python Turtle Fill Color Red"></a></p>
<p>To change the color of the pen (or the outline), you type the following:</p>
<div class="highlight python repl"><span class="repl-toggle" title="Toggle REPL prompts and output">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">pencolor</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"green"</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Your turtle will look like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://files.realpython.com/media/Turtle_Pen_Color_Updated.362202ac18cb.png" target="_blank"><img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block border w-50" src="https://files.realpython.com/media/Turtle_Pen_Color_Updated.362202ac18cb.png" width="721" height="698" alt="Python Turtle Pen Color Updated Green"></a></p>
<p>To change the color of both, you type the following:</p>
<div class="highlight python repl"><span class="repl-toggle" title="Toggle REPL prompts and output">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">color</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"green"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"red"</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Your turtle will look like this:</p>

<p>Here, the first color is for the pen, and the second is for the fill. Note that changing the color of the pen and the fill also changes the color of the onscreen turtle accordingly.</p>
<h3 id="filling-in-an-image">Filling in an Image</h3>
<p>Coloring in an image usually makes it look better, doesn’t it? The Python <code>turtle</code> library gives you the option to add color to your drawings. Try typing in the following code and see what happens:</p>
<div class="highlight python repl"><span class="repl-toggle" title="Toggle REPL prompts and output">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">begin_fill</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">fd</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">lt</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">120</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">fd</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">lt</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">120</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">fd</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">end_fill</span><span class="p">()</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>When you execute this code, you’ll get a triangle that’s filled in with a solid color, like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://files.realpython.com/media/Turtle_Begin_End_Fill_GIF.849f73374a22.gif" target="_blank"><img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block border w-50" src="https://files.realpython.com/media/Turtle_Begin_End_Fill_GIF.849f73374a22.gif" width="478" height="462" alt="Python Turtle Begin Fill End Fill New"></a></p>
<p>When you use <code>.beginfill()</code>, you’re telling your program that you’re going to be drawing a closed shape which will need to be filled in. Then, you use <code>.endfill()</code> to indicate that you’re done creating your shape and it can now be filled in.</p>
<h3 id="changing-the-turtle-shape">Changing the Turtle Shape</h3>
<p>The initial shape of the turtle isn’t really a turtle, but a triangular figure. However, you can <strong>change the way the turtle looks</strong>, and you do have a couple of options when it comes to doing so. You can have a look at some of them by typing in the following commands:</p>
<div class="highlight python repl"><span class="repl-toggle" title="Toggle REPL prompts and output">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">shape</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"turtle"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">shape</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"arrow"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">shape</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"circle"</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The shape of the turtle will change accordingly, like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://files.realpython.com/media/4-Turtle_Shape-Gif.daf6a648bd8c.gif" target="_blank"><img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block border w-50" src="https://files.realpython.com/media/4-Turtle_Shape-Gif.daf6a648bd8c.gif" width="478" height="462" alt="Python Turtle Shapes"></a></p>
<p>You have a couple of other options that you can try as well:</p>
<ul>
<li>Square</li>
<li>Arrow</li>
<li>Circle</li>
<li>Turtle</li>
<li>Triangle</li>
<li>Classic</li>
</ul>
<p>The classic shape is the original shape. Check out the Python <code>turtle</code> library <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#turtle.shape">documentation</a> to learn more about the types of shapes that you can use.</p>
<h3 id="changing-the-pen-speed">Changing the Pen Speed</h3>
<p>The turtle generally moves at a moderate pace. If you want to decrease or increase the <strong>speed</strong> to make your turtle move slower or faster, then you can do so by typing the following:</p>
<div class="highlight python repl"><span class="repl-toggle" title="Toggle REPL prompts and output">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">speed</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">forward</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">speed</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">forward</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This code will first decrease the speed and move the turtle forward, then increase the speed and move the turtle forward again, like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://files.realpython.com/media/Update_-_Turtle_Speed_1_and_10.a35c56e8f016.gif" target="_blank"><img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block border w-50" src="https://files.realpython.com/media/Update_-_Turtle_Speed_1_and_10.a35c56e8f016.gif" width="480" height="466" alt="Python Turtle Speed Updated"></a></p>
<p>The speed can be any number ranging from 0 (the slowest speed) to 10 (the highest speed). You can play around with your code to see how fast or slow the turtle will go.</p>
<h3 id="customizing-in-one-line">Customizing in One Line</h3>
<p>Suppose you want to set your turtle’s characteristics to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pen color:</strong> purple</li>
<li><strong>Fill color:</strong> orange</li>
<li><strong>Pen size:</strong> 10</li>
<li><strong>Pen speed:</strong> 9</li>
</ul>
<p>From what you’ve just learned, the code should look something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight python repl"><span class="repl-toggle" title="Toggle REPL prompts and output">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">pencolor</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"purple"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">fillcolor</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"orange"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">pensize</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">speed</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">9</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">begin_fill</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">circle</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">90</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">end_fill</span><span class="p">()</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>It’s pretty long, but not that bad, right?</p>
<p>Now, just imagine if you had <strong>ten different turtles</strong>. Changing all of their characteristics would be extremely tiresome for you to do! The good news is that you can reduce your workload by altering the parameters in just a single line of code, like this:</p>
<div class="highlight python repl"><span class="repl-toggle" title="Toggle REPL prompts and output">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">pen</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">pencolor</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"purple"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">fillcolor</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"orange"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">pensize</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">speed</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">9</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">begin_fill</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">circle</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">90</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">end_fill</span><span class="p">()</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This will give you a result like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://files.realpython.com/media/TURTLE_EDIT_SINGLE_LINE_CUSTOMISATION_GIF.c30c0839af72.gif" target="_blank"><img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block border w-50" src="https://files.realpython.com/media/TURTLE_EDIT_SINGLE_LINE_CUSTOMISATION_GIF.c30c0839af72.gif" width="480" height="466" alt="Python Turtle Single Line Pen Newer"></a></p>
<p>This single line of code changed the entire pen, without you having to change each characteristic individually. To learn more about this command, check out the Python <code>turtle</code> library <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#turtle.pen">documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Great job! Now that you’ve learned to customize your turtle and the screen, take a look at some other important commands that are required while drawing with the Python <code>turtle</code> library.</p>
<h3 id="picking-the-pen-up-and-down">Picking the Pen Up and Down</h3>
<p>Sometimes, you may want to move your turtle to another point on the screen without drawing anything on the screen itself. To do this, you use <code>.penup()</code>. Then, when you want to start drawing again, you use <code>.pendown()</code>. Give it a shot using the code that you used previously to draw a square. Try typing the following code:</p>
<div class="highlight python repl"><span class="repl-toggle" title="Toggle REPL prompts and output">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">fd</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">rt</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">90</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">penup</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">fd</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">rt</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">90</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">pendown</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">fd</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">rt</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">90</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">penup</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">fd</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">pendown</span><span class="p">()</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>When you run this code, your output will look like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://files.realpython.com/media/Screenshot_2019-10-01_at_9.22.37_PM.20eeea07c674.png" target="_blank"><img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block border w-50" src="https://files.realpython.com/media/Screenshot_2019-10-01_at_9.22.37_PM.20eeea07c674.png" width="716" height="695" alt="Python Turtle Pen Up Pen Down Edit"></a></p>
<p>Here, you’ve obtained two parallel lines instead of a square by adding some extra commands in between the original program.</p>
<h3 id="undoing-changes">Undoing Changes</h3>
<p>No matter how careful you are, there’s always a possibility of making a mistake. Don’t worry, though! The Python <code>turtle</code> library gives you the option to undo what you’ve done. If you want to <strong>undo</strong> the very last thing you did, then type in the following:</p>
<div class="highlight python repl"><span class="repl-toggle" title="Toggle REPL prompts and output">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">undo</span><span class="p">()</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This undoes the last command that you ran. If you want to undo your last three commands, then you would type <code>t.undo()</code> three times.</p>
<h3 id="clearing-the-screen">Clearing the Screen</h3>
<p>Right now, you probably have a lot on your screen since you’ve started this tutorial. To make room for more, just type in the following command:</p>
<div class="highlight python repl"><span class="repl-toggle" title="Toggle REPL prompts and output">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">clear</span><span class="p">()</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This will clean up your screen so that you can continue drawing. Note here that your variables will not change, and the turtle will remain in the same position. If you have other turtles on your screen other than the original turtle, then their drawings will not be cleared out unless you specifically call them out in your code.</p>
<h3 id="resetting-the-environment">Resetting the Environment</h3>
<p>You also have the option to start on a clean slate with a <strong>reset</strong> command. The screen will get cleared up, and the turtle’s settings will all be restored to their default parameters. All you need to to do is type in the following command:</p>
<div class="highlight python repl"><span class="repl-toggle" title="Toggle REPL prompts and output">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">reset</span><span class="p">()</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This clears the screen and takes the turtle back to its home position. Your default settings, like the turtle’s size, shape, color, and other features, will also be restored.</p>
<p>Now that you’ve learned the fundamentals of programming with the Python <code>turtle</code> library, you’ll check out some bonus features that you may want to use while programming.</p>
<h3 id="leaving-a-stamp">Leaving a Stamp</h3>
<p>You have the option of leaving a <strong>stamp</strong> of your turtle on the screen, which is nothing but an imprint of the turtle. Try typing in this code to see how it works:</p>
<div class="highlight python repl"><span class="repl-toggle" title="Toggle REPL prompts and output">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">stamp</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="go">8</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">fd</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">stamp</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="go">9</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">fd</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Your output will look like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://files.realpython.com/media/RP_STAMPS_GIF.05609e29d05f.gif" target="_blank"><img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block border w-50" src="https://files.realpython.com/media/RP_STAMPS_GIF.05609e29d05f.gif" width="478" height="462" alt="Python Turtle Stamps Edit"></a></p>
<p>The numbers that appear are the turtle’s location or <strong>stamp ID</strong>. Now, if you want to remove a particular stamp, then just use the following:</p>
<div class="highlight python repl"><span class="repl-toggle" title="Toggle REPL prompts and output">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">clearstamp</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">8</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This will clear the one with the stamp ID of <code>8</code>.</p>
<h3 id="cloning-your-turtle">Cloning Your Turtle</h3>
<p>Sometimes, you may need to have more than one turtle on your screen. You’ll see an example of this later on in the final project. For now, you can get another turtle by <strong>cloning</strong> your current turtle into your environment. Try running this code to create a clone turtle, <code>c</code>, and then move both the turtles on the screen:</p>
<div class="highlight python repl"><span class="repl-toggle" title="Toggle REPL prompts and output">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">c</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">clone</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">color</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"magenta"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">c</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">color</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"red"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">circle</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">c</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">circle</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">60</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The output will look like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://files.realpython.com/media/TURTLE_EDIT_CLONE_GIF.1736204d0292.gif" target="_blank"><img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block border w-50" src="https://files.realpython.com/media/TURTLE_EDIT_CLONE_GIF.1736204d0292.gif" width="480" height="466" alt="Python Turtle Clone NEWER"></a></p>
<p>Awesome!</p>
<p>Now that you have an idea of some important commands from the Python <code>turtle</code> library, you’re ready to move on to a few more concepts that you’ll need to understand. These concepts are very much needed when it comes to programming in any language.</p>
<h2 id="using-loops-and-conditional-statements">Using Loops and Conditional Statements</h2>
<p>When you get into higher-level programming, you’ll find yourself using <strong>loops and conditional statements</strong> very often. That’s why, in this section, you’ll be going through a couple of turtle programs that make use of these types of commands. This will give you a practical approach when it comes to understanding these concepts. Before you begin, however, here are three definitions for you to keep in mind:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Loops</strong> are a set of instructions that are continuously repeated until a particular condition is satisfied.</li>
<li><strong>Conditional statements</strong> carry out a certain task based on a condition that’s satisfied.</li>
<li><strong>Indentations</strong> are used to define blocks of code, especially when using loops and conditional statements. In general, you create an indentation by tapping the <span class="keys"><kbd class="key-tab">Tab</kbd></span> key on the keyboard.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, let’s go ahead and explore these commands!</p>
<h3 id="for-loops"><code>for</code> Loops</h3>
<p>Do you remember the program that you used to create a square? You had to repeat the same line of code four times, like this:</p>
<div class="highlight python repl"><span class="repl-toggle" title="Toggle REPL prompts and output">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">fd</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">rt</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">90</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">fd</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">rt</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">90</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">fd</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">rt</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">90</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">fd</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">rt</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">90</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>A much shorter way to do this is with the help of a <a href="https://realpython.com/courses/python-for-loop/"><code>for</code> loop</a>. Try running this code:</p>
<div class="highlight python repl"><span class="repl-toggle" title="Toggle REPL prompts and output">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">range</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">):</span>
<span class="gp">... </span>    <span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">fd</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="gp">... </span>    <span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">rt</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">90</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Here, the <code>i</code> is like a <strong>counter</strong> that starts from zero and keeps increasing by 1. When you say <code>in range(4)</code>, you’re telling the program that the value of this <code>i</code> should be less than 4. It will terminate the program before <code>i</code> reaches 4.</p>
<p>Here’s a breakdown of how the program works:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>At i = 0,</strong> the turtle moves forward by 100 units and then turns 90 degrees to the right.</li>
<li><strong>At i = 0 + 1 = 1,</strong> the turtle moves forward by 100 units and then turns 90 degrees to the right.</li>
<li><strong>At i = 1 + 1 = 2,</strong> the turtle moves forward by 100 units and then turns 90 degrees to the right.</li>
<li><strong>At i = 2 + 1 = 3,</strong> the turtle moves forward by 100 units and then turns 90 degrees to the right.</li>
</ol>
<p>The turtle will then exit the loop. To check the value of <code>i</code>, type <code>i</code> and then press the <span class="keys"><kbd class="key-enter">Enter</kbd></span> key. You’ll get the value of <code>i</code> equal to 3:</p>
<div class="highlight python repl"><span class="repl-toggle" title="Toggle REPL prompts and output">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">i</span>
<span class="go">3</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Note that the whitespace that comes before line 2 and line 3 in the program is the <strong>indentation</strong>. This indicates that all 3 lines form a single block of code.

<h3 id="while-loops"><code>while</code> Loops</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://realpython.com/courses/mastering-while-loops/"><code>while</code> loop</a> is used to perform a certain task while a condition is still satisfied. If the condition is no longer satisfied, then your code will terminate the process. You can use a <code>while</code> loop to create a series of circles by typing in this code:</p>
<div class="highlight python repl"><span class="repl-toggle" title="Toggle REPL prompts and output">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">n</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">10</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="k">while</span> <span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="mi">40</span><span class="p">:</span>
<span class="gp">... </span>    <span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">circle</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">n</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="gp">... </span>    <span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">n</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="mi">10</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>When you run this code, you’ll see the circles appearing one after the other, and each new circle will be larger than the previous one:</p>
<p><a href="https://files.realpython.com/media/TURTLE_EDIT_WHILE_LOOP_GIF.c0b9eae029cc.gif" target="_blank"><img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block border w-50" src="https://files.realpython.com/media/TURTLE_EDIT_WHILE_LOOP_GIF.c0b9eae029cc.gif" width="480" height="466" alt="Python Turtle While Loop Edited Newer"></a></p>
<p>Here, <code>n</code> is used as a counter. You’ll need to specify by how much you want the value of <code>n</code> to increase in each loop. Take a look at this mini walk-through to see how the program works:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>At n = 10,</strong> the turtle draws a circle with a radius of 10 units. After that, the value of <code>n</code> is increased by 10.</li>
<li><strong>At n = 20,</strong> the turtle draws a circle with a radius of 20 units. Once again, the value of <code>n</code> is increased by 10.</li>
<li><strong>At n = 30,</strong> the turtle draws a circle with a radius of 30 units. For the third time, the value of <code>n</code> is increased by 10.</li>
<li><strong>At n = 40,</strong> the turtle draws a circle with a radius of 40 units. For the last time, the value of <code>n</code> is increased by 10.</li>
<li><strong>At n = 50,</strong> <code>n</code> is no longer less than or equal to 40. The loop is terminated.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="conditional-statements">Conditional Statements</h3>
<p>You use <a href="https://realpython.com/courses/python-conditional-statements/">conditional statements</a> to check if a given condition is true. If it is, then the corresponding command is executed. Try typing in this program:</p>
<div class="highlight python repl"><span class="repl-toggle" title="Toggle REPL prompts and output">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">u</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">input</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"Would you like me to draw a shape? Type yes or no: "</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">u</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s2">"yes"</span><span class="p">:</span>
<span class="gp">... </span>    <span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">circle</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">50</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p><code>input()</code> is used to obtain <strong>input</strong> from the user. Here, it will store the user’s response under the variable <code>u</code>. Next, it will compare the value of <code>u</code> with the condition provided and check whether the value of <code>u</code> is <code>"yes"</code>. If it’s <code>"yes"</code>, then your program draws a circle. If the user types in anything else, then the program won’t do anything.</p>
<div class="alert alert-primary">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The comparison operator <code>==</code> indicates a <strong>comparison</strong>. It’s used to check if the value of something is equal to something else. The assignment operator <code>=</code> is used to assign a value to something. To learn more about the differences between the two, check out <a href="https://realpython.com/python-operators-expressions/">Operators and Expressions in Python</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>When you add an <code>else</code> clause to an <code>if</code> statement, you can specify two results based on whether the condition is true or false. Let’s see this in a program:</p>
<div class="highlight python repl"><span class="repl-toggle" title="Toggle REPL prompts and output">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">u</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">input</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"Would you like me to draw a shape? Type yes or no: "</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">u</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s2">"yes"</span><span class="p">:</span>
<span class="gp">... </span>    <span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">circle</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">50</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="k">else</span><span class="p">:</span>
<span class="gp">... </span>    <span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"Okay"</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Here, you tell the program to display a particular output even when the user does not say <code>"yes"</code>. You use <code>print()</code> to display some pre-defined characters on the screen.</p>
<p>Note that the user doesn’t need to type <code>"no"</code>. They can type anything else, in which case, the result will always be <code>"Okay"</code>, because you’re not explicitly telling the program that the user needs to type <code>"no"</code>. Not to worry, however, as that can be fixed. You can add an <code>elif</code> clause to provide the program with several conditions and their respective outputs, as you can observe here:</p>
<div class="highlight python repl"><span class="repl-toggle" title="Toggle REPL prompts and output">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">u</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">input</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"Would you like me to draw a shape? Type yes or no: "</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">u</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s2">"yes"</span><span class="p">:</span>
<span class="gp">... </span>    <span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">circle</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">50</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="k">elif</span> <span class="n">u</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s2">"no"</span><span class="p">:</span>
<span class="gp">... </span>    <span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"Okay"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="k">else</span><span class="p">:</span>
<span class="gp">... </span>    <span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"Invalid Reply"</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>As you can see, this program now has more than one outcome, depending on the input it receives. Here’s how this code works:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>If you type in <code>"yes"</code>,</strong> then the code processes the input and draws a circle, as per your instructions.</li>
<li><strong>If you type in <code>"no"</code>,</strong> then the code prints out <code>"Okay"</code> and your program is terminated.</li>
<li><strong>If you type in anything else,</strong> like <code>"Hello"</code> or <code>"Sandwich"</code>, then the code prints <code>"Invalid Reply"</code> and your program is terminated.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that this program is case-sensitive, so when you’re trying it out, be sure to put the strings in upper-case or lower-case accordingly.</p>

<h2 id="final-project-the-python-turtle-race">Final Project: The Python Turtle Race</h2>
<p>So far, you’ve learned how to customize your turtle environment, program your turtle to move around the screen, and use loops and conditional statements to improve your code. Now it’s time for the most important part of your programming journey. In this section, you’ll be implementing all that you’ve learned into a single program by creating a fun game that you can play with your friends.</p>
<p>Before you begin, here’s what you need to know about the game:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>The Objective:</strong> The player whose turtle reaches its home first wins the game.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>How to Play:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Each player rolls a dice to get a number.</li>
<li>The player then moves their turtle by that many steps.</li>
<li>The players alternate turns until one of them wins.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Structure:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Each player had a turtle indicated by a different color. You can have more than two players, but for the sake of this tutorial, you’ll be creating a two-player game.</li>
<li>Each turtle has a home position that it must reach.</li>
<li>Each player uses a die to choose a value at random for their turn. In your program, the die is represented by a list of numbers from 1 to 6.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Now that you’ve understood the logic of the game, you can go ahead and begin creating it! First, you’ll need to set up the environment.</p>
<h3 id="setting-up-the-game-environment">Setting Up the Game Environment</h3>
<p>Start by importing the Python <code>turtle</code> library. After this, import the built-in <code>random</code> library, which you’ll use randomly select an item from a list:</p>
<div class="highlight python repl"><span class="repl-toggle" title="Toggle REPL prompts and output">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">turtle</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">random</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Once these libraries are successfully called into your environment, you can proceed with the rest of your program.</p>
<h3 id="setting-up-the-turtles-and-homes">Setting Up the Turtles and Homes</h3>
<p>You now have to create the two turtles that will represent the players. Each turtle will be a different color, corresponding to the different players. Here, player one is <strong>green</strong> and player two is <strong>blue</strong>:</p>
<div class="highlight python repl"><span class="repl-toggle" title="Toggle REPL prompts and output">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">player_one</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">turtle</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Turtle</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">player_one</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">color</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"green"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">player_one</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">shape</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"turtle"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">player_one</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">penup</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">player_one</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">goto</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">200</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">player_two</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">player_one</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">clone</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">player_two</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">color</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"blue"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">player_two</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">penup</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">player_two</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">goto</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">200</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>One you’ve created the turtles, you place them at their starting positions and make sure that these positions are aligned. Note that you created player two’s turtle by cloning player one’s turtle, changing its color, and placing it at a different starting point.</p>
<p>You now need to set up homes for the turtles. These homes will act as the finishing points for each turtle. Each of the turtles’ <strong>homes</strong> will be represented by a circle. Here, you need to make sure that both homes are equidistant from the starting point:</p>
<div class="highlight python repl"><span class="repl-toggle" title="Toggle REPL prompts and output">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">player_one</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">goto</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">300</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">60</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">player_one</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">pendown</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">player_one</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">circle</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">40</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">player_one</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">penup</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">player_one</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">goto</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">200</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">player_two</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">goto</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">300</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">140</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">player_two</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">pendown</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">player_two</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">circle</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">40</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">player_two</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">penup</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">player_two</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">goto</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">200</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>After drawing the respective homes, you send the turtles back to their starting positions:</p>
<p><a href="https://files.realpython.com/media/UPDATE_Turtle_Race_Setup_Blue_and_Green.16e6da3cc20d.png" target="_blank"><img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block border w-50" src="https://files.realpython.com/media/UPDATE_Turtle_Race_Setup_Blue_and_Green.16e6da3cc20d.png" width="721" height="699" alt="Python Turtle Race Setup Updated"></a></p>
<p>Awesome! The visual aspects of your game are complete. You can now create the die that you’ll be using to play the game.</p>
<h3 id="creating-the-die">Creating the Die</h3>
<p>You can create a virtual die for your game with a <strong><a href="https://realpython.com/courses/lists-tuples-python/">list</a></strong>, which is an ordered sequence of items. In real life, you might prepare grocery lists and to-do lists to help you stay organized. In Python, lists work in a similar way.</p>
<p>In this case, you’ll be using a list to create your die. First, you define your list of numbers in ascending order from 1 to 6. You can define a list by giving it a name and then enclosing its items within square brackets, like this:</p>
<div class="highlight python repl"><span class="repl-toggle" title="Toggle REPL prompts and output">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">die</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">6</span><span class="p">]</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This list has now become your die. To roll the dice, all you have to do is program your system to randomly select a number from it. The number that is selected will be considered as the output of the die.</p>
<h3 id="developing-the-game">Developing the Game</h3>
<p>It’s time to develop the code for the rest of the game. You’ll be using loops and conditional statements here, so you need to be careful with the indentations and spaces. To start, take a look at the steps your program will need to take to run the game:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Step 1:</strong> You’ll start by telling your program to check if either turtle has reached its home.</li>
<li><strong>Step 2:</strong> If they haven’t, then you’ll tell your program to allow the players to continue trying.</li>
<li><strong>Step 3:</strong> In each loop, you tell your program to roll the die by randomly picking a number from the list.</li>
<li><strong>Step 4:</strong> You then tell it to move the respective turtle accordingly, with the number of steps based on the outcome of this random selection.</li>
</ol>
<p>The program keeps repeating this process, and stops once one of the turtles reaches the goal. Here’s how the code looks:</p>

<p>Your final output will look a little something like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://files.realpython.com/media/Update_-_Turtle_Race_Green_and_Blue.b1ee6be37a9f.gif" target="_blank"><img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block border w-50" src="https://files.realpython.com/media/Update_-_Turtle_Race_Green_and_Blue.b1ee6be37a9f.gif" width="480" height="470" alt="Python Turtle Race Updated"></a></p>
<p>In summary, this is what the code is doing:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Line 1</strong> sets up a <code>for</code> loop with a range from 1 to 20.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lines 2 through 7</strong> check if either player has reached their goal. If one of them has, then the program prints out the corresponding statement and breaks the loop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Line 8</strong> moves the program on to the next set of steps if neither player has won.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Line 9</strong> prints out a statement asking player one to press the <span class="keys"><kbd class="key-enter">Enter</kbd></span> key to roll the die.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Line 10</strong> takes a random value from the list <code>die</code> and stores it in <code>dice_outcome</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Line 11</strong> prints a statement prior to displaying the outcome of the dice roll.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Line 12</strong> prints the dice outcome.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Line 14</strong> multiplies this value by 20 to reduce the overall number of steps required to complete the game.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Line 15</strong> moves player one’s turtle forward by this number of steps.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lines 16 to 22</strong> repeat these steps for player two.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The entire <code>for</code> loop is repeated until one of the player’s turtles reaches the final position.</p>
<div class="alert alert-primary">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> In Python, you use the asterisk (<code>*</code>) to indicate multiplication. This is known as an <strong>arithmetic operator</strong>. You can also use the plus sign (<code>+</code>) for addition, the minus sign (<code>-</code>) for subtraction, and a slash (<code>/</code>) for division. To learn more about arithmetic operators, check out the Arithmetic Operators section of <a href="https://realpython.com/python-operators-expressions/#arithmetic-operators">Operators and Expressions in Python</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>Remember, you can customize the game however you want, so go ahead and play around with it! You can add more turtles, change the colors, change the speed, or even create some obstacles to challenge your players. It’s all up to you as the developer of the game!</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In this tutorial, you’ve learned how to program with the Python <code>turtle</code> library and grasped some very important programming concepts. You know how to deal with variable initialization, loops, conditional statements, indentations, lists, and operators. This is a great start for you, especially if you’re new to the Python programming language!</p>

<hr><h3 class="post"><a href="https://pybit.es/" title="PyBites">PyBites</a></h3>


<h4><a href="https://pybit.es/guest-howto-write-guest-posts.html">How to Write a Guest Article for PyBites</a></h4>
<p>
</p><p>Hello Everybody! In this article I'll run through the procedure of using git and github to submit a guest article to PyBites.</p>
<h3>1. Forking the Repository</h3>
<p>In order to get started, you have to create a fork of the original repository.
A fork is a copy of a project to your own Github account.</p>
<p>This way, you can work on your own copy and ask the project maintainer to accept some modifications on your copy into the main repository.</p>
<p>Head over to the <a href="https://github.com/pybites/pybites.github.io-src/">PyBites blog Github repo</a> and look for the Fork icon in the top right, I've marked it in green:</p>
<p><img alt="Github Fork" src="https://pybit.es/feeds/images/howtoguest/github_fork.png"></p>
<p>Git will start creating the copy, and when it's done, you'll have your very own pybites.github.io-src fork!</p>
<p><img alt="Github Forked" src="https://pybit.es/feeds/images/howtoguest/github_forked.png"></p>
<h3>2. Cloning your copy</h3>
<p>Now that we have our running fork, we can clone this from our own Github account. </p>
<p>A clone is a local copy of a project from your Github to your local machine, where you can start editing!</p>
<p><img alt="Git Clone" src="https://pybit.es/feeds/images/howtoguest/git_clone.png"></p>
<h3>3. Preparing for the future</h3>
<p>While you are making your edits or adding your article, the maintainers, or other contributors may be doing the same!
Git already knows of our origin, it knows where we cloned from. </p>
<p>We also need to tell it what our upstream is, where did we fork from? Which is where the maintainers will be adding updates.</p>
<p>In this case that's https://github.com/pybites/pybites.github.io-src</p>
<p><img alt="Git Remote" src="https://pybit.es/feeds/images/howtoguest/git_remote_origin.png"></p>
<p>So now, if we want to get the maintainers latest modifications and add them to our own repository, we can first pull the upstream master branch, and then push it to our origin master branch!</p>
<p><img alt="Git pull and push" src="https://pybit.es/feeds/images/howtoguest/git_pull_and_push.png"></p>
<h3>4. Before making modifications</h3>
<p>The Gittiquette says that you should make a branch before starting any modifications.</p>
<p>A branch is a copy of our local copy at a certain point in time that will go on to live it's on life, and eventually (hopefully) rejoin with it's master somewhere down the road.</p>
<p>You can either create a branch while checking it out, or you can create a branch, and later switch to it with checkout.</p>
<p><img alt="Git branch" src="https://pybit.es/feeds/images/howtoguest/github_branching.png"></p>
<p>You might want to set your branch name to something that you can recognize. Some trees have a lot of branches!</p>
<p>I'm currently writing this "how to add guest articles", so I'll give mine an obvious name:</p>
<p><img alt="My branch name" src="https://pybit.es/feeds/images/howtoguest/howto_guest_article.png"></p>
<p>Branching is mainly important when you want to verify that your new modifications are not conflicting with any new changes in the upstream.</p>
<h3>5. Writing your article</h3>
<p><strong>Post directory and style</strong></p>
<p>Guest articles are stored in <a href="https://github.com/pybites/pybites.github.io-src/tree/master/content">content</a>, are written in markdown and usually start with <strong>guest-</strong></p>
<p><img alt="Guest posts" src="https://pybit.es/feeds/images/howtoguest/guest_posts.png"></p>
<p>I've added a template you can use <a href="https://github.com/pybites/pybites.github.io-src/templates">here</a></p>
<p>It contains the structure of most articles and some basic markdown syntax as example, [here]'s another cheat sheet for if you want to do even more!</p>
<p>You can also look at the other articles as an example.</p>
<p><strong>Adding images</strong></p>
<p>If you have images you want to add (screenshots, infographics,...), you can add them under <code>content/images/</code> and refer to them in your article like this:</p>
<p><code>![Image Alt Text](images/your-image.png)</code></p>
<p><strong>A new guest!</strong></p>
<p>If this is your first article, you should also add a small bio in content/pages/guests.md, right above the comment:</p>
<p><code>&lt;!-- insert your new bio above this line --&gt;</code></p>
<p>You can copy one from the guests file yourself, or use the <a href="https://github.com/pybites/pybites.github.io-src/tree/master/templates">template</a> for the bio. </p>
<h3>6. Adding and commiting your changes</h3>
<p>Commit's are collections of small changes you have made. Adding your article could probably go in a single commit.
You're going to tell git that you've changed or added a bunch of files first:</p>
<p><img alt="git add" src="https://pybit.es/feeds/images/howtoguest/git_add.png"></p>
<p>...and then you're gonna store these changes in a commit:</p>
<p><img alt="Commit Some" src="https://pybit.es/feeds/images/howtoguest/commit_some.png"></p>
<p>I still have some work to do, but when you're ready, you can push your modified branch back to the branch on it's origin you've created for the modifications:</p>
<p><img alt="Push your changes" src="https://pybit.es/feeds/images/howtoguest/pushing_our_changes.png"></p>
<p>And you're all set!</p>
<p>If you're logged in and you go to the upstream github page, you'll notice github automatically detects you've pushed a branch that was related to this project!</p>
<p><img alt="Upstream Knows" src="https://pybit.es/feeds/images/howtoguest/upstream_knows.png"></p>
<p>And you can create a pull request, which effectively asks the maintainer to pull the changes you've made into the master branch.</p>
<p><img alt="Pull request" src="https://pybit.es/feeds/images/howtoguest/pull_request.png"></p>
<p>Now all you have to do is wait for someone to review your changes and if they are approved, your article will soon be ours to read on the PyBites blog!</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>Thanks for reading, I hope you enjoyed it as much as I enjoyed writing it.
If you have any remarks or questions, you can likely find me on the <a href="https://pybit.es/feeds/pages/community.html">Pybites Slack Channel</a> as 'Jarvis'.</p>
<p>Keep calm and code in Python!</p>

<h4><a href="https://no-title.victordomingos.com/articles/2020/book_review_machine_learning_with_python">Book review - Machine Learning with Python for Everyone, By Mark E.&nbsp;Fenner</a></h4>
<p>
</p><p>Machine learning, one of the hottest tech topics of today, is being used more and more. Sometimes as the best tool for the job, other times perhaps as a buzzword that is mainly used as a way to make a product look cooler. However, without knowing what <span class="caps">ML</span> is and how it works behind the scenes, it’s very easy to get lost. But this book does a great job in guiding you all the way up from very simple math concepts to some sophisticated machine learning&nbsp;techniques.</p><p></p>

<h4><a href="https://wingware.com/blog/anaconda-envs">Using Anaconda Environments with Wing Python IDE</a></h4>
<p>
</p><p>Wing version 7.2 <a class="reference" href="https://wingware.com/news/2020-01-20">has been released</a>, and we've
been looking at the new features in this version. So far we've covered <a class="reference" href="https://wingware.com/hints/reformatting">reformatting
with Black and YAPF</a>, Wing 7.2's <a class="reference" href="https://wingware.com/hints/virtualenv">expanded
support for virtualenv</a>, and <a class="reference" href="https://wingware.com/hints/python-m">using python -m
with Wing</a>.</p>
<p>This time we'll take a look at what Wing 7.2 provides for people that are using Anaconda
environments created with <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">conda</span> <span class="pre">create</span></tt> as an alternative to virtualenv.</p>
<div class="section">
<h3 class="title-3">What Wing 7.2 Adds</h3>
<p>Wing 7.2 supports creating new Wing projects that use an existing Anaconda environment, so
that the environment is automatically activated whenever the project is open. Debug
processes, unit tests, the integrated Python Shell, and OS Commands all run in the
activated environment.</p>
<p>Wing 7.2 also added the ability to create and configure a new Anaconda environment while
creating a new Wing project.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h3 class="title-3">Using an Existing Anaconda Environment</h3>
<p>Wing tries to discover existing Anaconda environments and lists them in the drop down menu
next to the <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Activated</span> <span class="pre">Env</span></tt> option under <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Python</span> <span class="pre">Executable</span></tt> in <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Project</span> <span class="pre">Properties</span></tt>
and the <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">New</span> <span class="pre">Project</span></tt> dialog, which are both in the <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Project</span></tt> menu:</p>
<img src="https://wingware.com/images/blog/anaconda-envs/discovered-envs.png" alt="/images/blog/anaconda-envs/discovered-envs.png" class="doc-image" width="606px"><p>Selecting one of the listed Anaconda environments configures the project to automatically
activate that environment whenever the project is open:</p>
<img src="https://wingware.com/images/blog/anaconda-envs/selected-env.png" alt="/images/blog/anaconda-envs/selected-env.png" class="doc-image" width="606px"><p>If Wing cannot find your Anaconda environment automatically, you can instead manually
enter the command that activates it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h3 class="title-3">Creating New Projects</h3>
<p>Wing can also create a new Anaconda environment at the same time that a new Wing project
is created. This is done by selected <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">New</span> <span class="pre">Project</span></tt> from the <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Project</span></tt> menu and
choosing <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Create</span> <span class="pre">New</span> <span class="pre">Anaconda</span> <span class="pre">Environment</span></tt> as the project type:</p>
<img src="https://wingware.com/images/blog/anaconda-envs/new-project.png" alt="/images/blog/anaconda-envs/new-project.png" class="doc-image" width="600px"><p>Wing will create the new environment, install packages, and then configure and save a project file.  You
can immediately start working in your new environment, which Wing automatically activates for you
whenever you have the project open.</p>
<p>That's all there is to it!</p>
<p>For some additional details, see <a class="reference" href="https://wingware.com/doc/howtos/anaconda">Using Wing with Anaconda</a>.</p>
<br>
<br><p>That's it for now! We'll be back soon with more <a class="reference" href="http://wingware.com/hints">Wing Tips</a> for Wing
Python IDE.</p>

<p>
In this episode, we worked on a weekly view for the Django app. We made navigation that would let users click from one week to the next, then fixed up the view to pull time from that particular week.
The first thing that I did was focus on the UI required to navigate to a new weekly view in the app. We mocked out the UI and talked briefly about the flexbox layout that is available to modern browsers.</p>

<p>
A completely finished “loop” is when you can provide the required input to your system, and it produces the desired output (or side effects, if that’s how you like it). The “Close the loop first” technique is about closing this loop as fast as possible by creating a barebones version of it first, providing all or some required inputs, and generating a partial form of the desired output.
Once we have closed this barebones loop, we can then begin implementing behaviours from the inside out, so that with each new change our loop starts looking more like the actual system we want.</p>

<p>
<span>On behalf of the entire Python development community, and the currently serving Python release team in particular, I’m&nbsp;</span><span>pleased to announce the release of two of the latest Python editions.</span><br>
<br>
<span><b><span>Python 3.8.2</span></b></span><br>
<br>
<span>Python 3.8.2 is the second maintenance release of Python 3.8 and contains two months worth of bug fixes. Detailed</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>information about all changes made in 3.8.2 can be found in</span><span><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span><a class="" href="https://docs.python.org/release/3.8.2/whatsnew/changelog.html#python-3-8-2-final">its change log</a><span>. Note that compared to 3.8.1, version 3.8.2</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>also contains the changes introduced in 3.8.2rc1 and 3.8.2rc2.</span><br>
<br>
<span>The Python 3.8 series is the newest feature release of the Python language, and it contains many new features and</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>optimizations. You can find Python 3.8.2 here:</span><br>
